# KataGameOfLife

This little project is a Kata for wemanity.

I have choose the subject Game of life. 

The rules are the followings : 
  - 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  - 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
  - 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  - 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
  
  I have choose to make the test in correlation with the rules of the game, some edges case and to test strengthness.
